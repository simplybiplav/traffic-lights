```
Consider a crossroad traffic light as shown below and assume that:

* Green goes to yellow and yellow goes to red
* Red goes directly to green (without an intermediate stage showing yellow)
* If a pedestrian has pushed the "request to cross" button, an all-red-for-cars stage will take 
place before the cycle restarts
